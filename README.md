# Theano-Lasagne-tutorial

So you have read the theoretical aspect of Neural Nets, what they are how they work, what
are the hyper parameters and so on. Now whe you start to initialize Neural nets, you will
find that there are many libraries in many languages which can help you with it, for example
Caffe, Tensor fow, etc.

Among the many options there is also Theano. Theano is a Python library that allows you to
define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays
efficiently. For starting out it is great!

Lasagne is a lightweight library to build and train neural networks in Theano. It makes theano
code even easier to handle.

As many would suggest, the tutorials at [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/index.html)
are the best source to start the practical part of Neural Networks.

I have combined the tutorial at [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/index.html),
,[Lasagne](https://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/).
It has been presented in the form of jupyter notebooks, as I personally am a fan of learning in small bite
size chunks. For a deeper preview I would suggest the original source material, which is really great.

This work was also done for my own understanding of implementing Convoluted Neural Networks.
